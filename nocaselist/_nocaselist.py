    A case-insensitive and case-preserving list.

    The list is case-insensitive: Whenever items of the list are looked up by
    value or item values are compared, that is done case-insensitively. The
    case-insensitivity is defined by performing the lookup or comparison on
    the result of the ``lower()`` method on list items. Therefore, list items
    must support the ``lower()`` method. If a list item does not do that,
    :exc:`py:AttributeError` is raised.

    The list is case-preserving: Whenever the value of list items is returned,
    they have the lexical case that was originally specified when adding
    or updating the item.

    Except for the case-insensitivity of its items, it behaves like, and is
    in fact derived from, the built-in :class:`py:list` class in order to
    facilitate type checks.

    The implementation maintains a second list with the lower-cased items of
    the inherited list, and ensures that both lists are in sync.

    The list supports serialization via the Python :mod:`py:pickle` module.
    To save space and time, only the originally cased list is serialized.
